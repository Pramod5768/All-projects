I have dedicatedly made these two amazing Machine Learning Projects using core Python knowledge and its associated libraries like NUMPY, PANDAS, SEABORN,SK-LEARN , SCIPY etc. With the help
of deep understanding of algorithms with statistcal assistance and trial and error method, I have doen the hyperparamter tuning. Handling  & manupulating Dataframes was challenging and I have
learnt a lot from it though EDA was fun during visualisation  and gaining some cruicial insights. Here are the details about the projects:

MARKET SEGEMENTATION ( MACHINE LEARNING )


•Knowing idea behind maket segmentation and studying features
•EDA and feature engineering
•Feature extraction using Principal component analysis 
•Fitting different clustering algorithms (k-means, heirarchical clustering,dbscan)
•Validating models using silhouette score
•Model building using k-means
•Testing model accuracy using decision tree


SALES FORECASTING ( TIME SERIES | ARIMA )

•Data collection, understanding the data and data preprocessing
•Data preprocessing and EDA
•Stationarity testing using Augmented dicky fuller test and differencing to make time series stationary 
•Determining order of ARIMA using ACF and PACF plots
•Model fitting and model evaluation
•Forecasting
